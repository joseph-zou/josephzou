              Inspired by my sister's two cats Kai and Lint and my cat
              allergies, I created digital copies of them to house all my tools.
              They are able to walk around the edges of my screen but are small
              enough to not be intrustive. I've also created a script to run on
              start up to run the program so they are always there. Not a day
              goes by I don't use one of the tools.

              State and Singleton Design Pattern
            </p>
            <p className="project-sub-subheading-paragraph">
              This project required me to learn about various design pattern in
              order to build it. The state pattern was used to manage the
              various states (direction, orientation, action) of the sprite. The
              singleton pattern was used to host a single source of truth for
              the app state's data.

              Sprite logic / Transisition manager / Event generator
            </p>
            <p className="project-sub-subheading-paragraph">
              Most of sprites frames are logically altered to match its correct
              direction, so I cached it to improve performance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="project-sub-subheading-paragraph">
              In order to provide smooth and realistic movement, I needed a way
              to ensure it transitioned to valid states or added the
              intermediate states to reach it. For example if it was on the
              floor (taskbar) and wanted to go to the left wall (left edge) it
              needed to flip direction if necessary and walk to it. Or if it
              wanted to go to the ceiling (top edge) it needed to go through one
              of the walls.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="project-sub-subheading-paragraph">
              The event generator managed directional change and action change.
              For now every 10 mins it changes action and every 5 mins it
              changes direction. It sends a request to change to the transition
              manager which faciliates the action.
            </p>

            <p className="project-sub-subheading-paragraph">
              <i>Challenge: </i>Given tkinter's (the gui system this project
              uses) single event loop similar to javascript's it was difficult
              to handle transitions and scheduling while ensuring the UI was
              unblocked. I used callbacks and allowed the sprite to handles its
              own exit logic in its abstract base class.

              I started to add tools to the sprite, for weather and dictionary I

              rest of the tools were built to spec of existing tools.
